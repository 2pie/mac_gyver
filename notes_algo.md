I followed the tutorials:

to get started with pygame, seting up the screen, 
moving objects, placing boundaries.

I wrote a toy program to follow the video.
Since the tutorial was not very far from the type of game I had to design, I then progressively modify this program to create my game.

I followed the following steps

# Movement and boundaries
Create an empty screen, and a rectange that moves in this screen. Prevent rectangle from leaving the screen.


From the start, I used an Object oriented programming approach. I defined the object player.

Then I added a class Wall stopping player in case of collision.

Once I had the basic structure of the code (i.e. my player class and my wall class), I designed the shape of the labyrinth with blocks.
